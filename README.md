This is a Python-based web crawler, which is used to capture the complete list of movie names in the Top250 list of Douban movies. Through paging request and HTML parsing, the current list data can be obtained stably.

functional performance
Automatic paging crawling (25 data per page)
Intelligent filtering of multilingual titles (only Chinese main titles are reserved)
The request header masquerades to bypass the basic anti-crawling mechanism.
Accurate DOM parsing based on BeautifulSoup

python
# Paging logic (0-225 step size 25)
for start_num in range(0, 250, 25):
# Construct a URL with paging parameters
content = requests.get(f"https://...start={start_num}",...)

# Use CSS class to locate accurately (Page 6)
all = soup.find_all("div", attrs={"class": "hd"})

# Title filtering mechanism
